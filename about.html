    <h2>Description of the Project</h2>
    <p>
      This project is meant to teach the team on how to create a website
      using html. We used Eleventy, a static site generator to help us
      create pages of cars. We also used pictures from Pexels, as well as
      some other information related to them, such as their photographers.
      The only CSS used in this project was MVP.css, which is a minimalist
      stylesheet.
